This is a portfolio I created from the work I did in CSC 6585 or Secure Software Development. Here is a description of this course:

The proposed Secure Software Development course will teach students about the design and development of secure software such that insecure coding patterns and security misconfigurations are mitigated early in the software life cycle. Students will learn about different types of insecure configurations, coding patterns, and vulnerabilities. They will also get hands-on experience on program analysis techniques, such as fuzzing and static analysis. Furthermore, they will learn about requirements analysis and design of secure software. Upon completion of the course, students will be able to develop their own program analysis tools, which will apply software security knowledge of test systems for security vulnerabilities.

Also, I have the exams from this course as well just let me know if you want to see what was on the Midterm and the Final (note this applies only to recruitors and/or professors).
